Welcome to my website! I am a MSc student in Statistics and Data Science at [University of Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html). My research interests focus on modelling dynamic human systems, dynamic climate systems and dynamic human-climate systems. I look forward to assessing climate risk in a changing globe with state-of-the-art statistical methods. 

Prior to my study in Leuven, I completed a MSc Earthquake Engineering with Disaster Management at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and a BEng Civil Engineering at [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/), and conducted research at [Water Equity Lab](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/allaire/) of [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/).
